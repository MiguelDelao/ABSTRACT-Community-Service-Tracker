# ABSTRACT Community Service Tracker

This was developed by Miguel Delao-Zurita for the FBLA Coding and Programming challenge.

### Important
Due to the depcreciated nature of WPF windows forms and this project being made 3 years ago, unfortunately I am unable to fix the installation at the moment. For the time, this project is a proof of my hard work. 


### Prerequisites

The .NET Framework is the only prerequisite for this project.

### Installing

You may choose to install the application directly to your computer. You can do so by opening "setup.exe" under the "Installations" folder. However, it will not have the sample database. You can also choose to just open the app shortcut.



# App Documentation
This will hold all the documentation for the app. These buttons fall under the Admin Hub. To access the admin hub, the username and password is both admin.


## All Students

* GENERAL
This tab gives you a list of all the students in the database in the form of a data grid. You can edit people as well by selecting them and the text boxes fill in with that persons info. 

* FILTER
Under the filter expander you can filter the data grid to whatever you want. For example, if you just want to see just 9th graders that have the community award, then you can do so there. 

* PRINT
Clicking the print button generates a PDF with all the information  in the data grid. If the data grid is filtered, it will generate the report with just the filtered data.

## Statistics
Here you can see all sorts data on the students, like average hours per award, the top and bottom 5 students, and average per grade.

## Create Student
This is where you create new students. You can choose to only create a student, or add the event that they participated in. 

## Edit Student
This is where you can see the individual events from a student.

Select a student by clicking under the "Select Student By Name" tab. 

You can change the persons First name, Last name, and grade by clicking on each one respectively.. The update button underneath it will make the changes. 

Clicking the red  button will delete whatever event you have selected.
## Student View

Student view let's you see their award and all the events they have participated in. You can create and delete new events here for the individual student. You can also compare your hours with others in the database by placing.

This view is very limited, and won't have as much control as the admin.

To access student view, the username is the persons first name, and their password is the first two letters of their last name and their ID. 
For example, John Smith 6978  has the username:john password:sm6978.
